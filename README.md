# PORTFOLIO NEXT.JS 15

A personalized portfolio website designed to showcase my work and skills in front-end development. The site will be built as a modern, reactive web application using **Next.js 15 App Router** and **TypeScript** to ensure robust typing and code stability. I will focus on leveraging popular libraries and state management tools like **Zustand** or **Redux** to demonstrate my expertise in building complex **PWA** applications, as well as implementing engaging animations.

The website will feature interactive sections such as projects, a biography, and a blog, enabling visitors to easily explore my work. Additionally, I plan to incorporate performance optimization, responsive design, and accessibility to ensure the application is user-friendly across all devices and platforms. The primary goal is for my portfolio to highlight my creativity, technical expertise, and attention to detail in developing web applications.
